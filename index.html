    <p class="one">I was born and raised in a family of 4, and I am the lastborn. I was raised in rural and was always curious about technology.</p>
    <p class="two">Being curious about technology made me pursue a degree in computer science at Masinde Muliro University of sience and technology, after passing High school <br> with flying colors at Sinyolo Girls High school. I am current in my last semester in school that is 4.2. </p>
    <p class="three">My mother motivates me to continue working smart in life because I want to give the best life she has never had before. My goal is to work as a developer in a software company. <br> I also want to be rich so that I can adopt other children help others.</p>
